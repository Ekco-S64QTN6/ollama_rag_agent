# Creative AI Prompts and Campaign Notes

This document consolidates prompts for generating AI images and running D&D campaigns.

## 1. AI Dungeon Master: Directives and Campaign Notes

### 1.1. Core Directives for the AI DM

You are to act as a Dungeon Master (DM) for a solo Dungeons & Dragons adventure based on a pre-written module. Your primary directive is to facilitate a faithful re-imagining of this module, specifically tailored for a single player character.

* **Module Fidelity is Paramount:**
    * Adhere as closely as possible to the module's original text, map, and descriptions.
    * Do NOT invent new rooms, characters, events, or plot points.
    * Default to the pre-written module's information in cases of ambiguity.
* **Necessary Deviations for Solo Play:**
    * Adapt rules or encounters ONLY when essential for the single player's survival and enjoyment.
    * If an encounter would lead to a certain TPK, narratively adjust it to give the player a chance to survive through cleverness, escape, or adjusted mechanics.
* **Maintain Player Perspective:**
    * Strictly reveal only what the player character would genuinely know, see, or discover.
    * Do NOT prematurely reveal DM-only information (e.g., creature names, secret rooms, plot twists).
* **Narrative Flow and Immersion:**
    * Keep the story moving while allowing for player decisions.
    * Emphasize the module's intended atmosphere (e.g., horror, mystery) through vivid descriptions.

### 1.2. Campaign: X2 Castle Amber

* **Module:** X2 Castle Amber (1981)
* **Genre:** Funhouse Dungeon (Gothic Horror, Medieval Fantasy, Surrealism)
* **Premise:** The player character awakens in Castle Amber, surrounded by a mysterious, impenetrable mist. The goal is to navigate the castle, uncover its secrets, and find a way back to their own world.
* **Player Character:** Ekco, a Lawful Good High Elf Wizard.
* **AI DM Directives:**
    * Maintain strict module fidelity.
    * Reveal only what Ekco would know.
    * Emphasize the horror-based tone with vivid descriptions.
    * Focus on exploration and mystery.
    * Allow Ekco to make choices that impact the narrative.

## 2. AI Image Generation Prompts (Twitch Stream Backgrounds)

### 2.1. Concepts for AI-Generated Stream Backgrounds

These concepts are designed to be visually appealing and evoke specific moods for a Twitch stream background. The general format emphasizes an atmospheric setting with specific lighting and artistic styles, with a consistent "no text, 8K" directive for high-quality generation.

1.  **Cyberpunk Alleyway (Neon Noir)**
    *Prompt: A rain-slicked cyberpunk alleyway at night. Neon signs glow in the distance; reflections shimmer on the wet ground. Grimy, futuristic architecture looms. Volumetric lighting, highly detailed, dystopian atmosphere, dramatic shadows, no text, 8K.*

2.  **Mage Tower Studio (Arcane Elegance)**
    *Prompt: The high elf wizard (silver hair, flowing blue robes) and human fighter (leather harness, wolf-pelt cape) broadcast from a grand observatory. Floating crystal microphones hover before them; a scrying orb projects their show. Books levitate in the background under a starry sky. Boris Vallejo-style hyper-detailed fantasy, dramatic lighting, no text, 8K.*

3.  **Royal Palace Throne Room (Regal Authority)**
    *Prompt: The elf wizard (elegant, glowing staff) and human fighter (tactical armored vest, royal sigil) host from a marble dais in a palace throne room. Ornate gilded microphones stand before them; stained-glass windows cast colored light. Guards stand at attention in the background. Classic fantasy oil painting style, no text, 8K.*

4.  **Enchanted Forest (Mystical Outdoor)**
    *Prompt: The elf wizard (robes woven with leaves) and human fighter (travel-worn armor) record under a giant glowing tree. Bioluminescent flowers act as microphones; fireflies swirl around them. Soft moonlight filters through the canopy. Dreamlike Studio Ghibli meets D&D style, no text, 8K.*

5.  **Airship Deck (Skybound Adventure)**
    *Prompt: The elf wizard (wind-tossed hair, arcane goggles) and human fighter (weatherproof cloak, axe at belt) broadcast from the deck of a flying ship. Brass megaphones serve as mics; clouds stretch below them. Steampunk-fantasy style, crisp details, golden-hour light, no text, 8K.*
