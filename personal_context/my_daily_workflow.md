# My Daily Workflow & Approach

This document outlines my typical daily routines, general habits, and preferred approaches to problem-solving and task management. This information helps Kaia understand my operational flow and provide contextually relevant assistance.

## Daily Routines

-   **Morning Routine:** Start the terminal, check Morgen for today's schedule and tasks, perform a quick system status check, and review recent system logs for anomalies.

## Task Management

-   **Calendar & Tasks:** Morgen is used for managing my calendar and daily tasks.
-   **Personal Projects & Notes:** Notion is used for personal project management and more comprehensive note-taking.

## Communication Tools

-   **Community:** Discord for general community interactions and discussions.
-   **Email:** Standard email for formal communications.

## Development & Technical Flow

-   **Terminal Multiplexer:** Heavily utilize `tmux` for persistent sessions and managing multiple terminal panes for different tasks.
-   **Development Style:** Focus on scripting and automating small, repetitive tasks.

## Documentation Habits

-   **Notes & Docs:** I prefer using Markdown for all my personal notes and simple project documentation.

## Breaks & Well-being

-   **Breaks:** I take short breaks as needed throughout the day to maintain focus and prevent burnout.

## Troubleshooting Approach

-   **Initial Steps:** My first step in diagnosing any issue is always to check relevant system logs (e.g., `journalctl` or specific logs in `/var/log/`).
